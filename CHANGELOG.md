## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-30

### Added

- Waveform tool: `:waveform` toggles the pane and `:global-tool waveform` toggles its global status.
- Tracks pane refits its height when the buffer of a pane changes.

### Changed

- `close-pane` is now `pane-close`; `quit` (`:q`, `:qa`) exits muse instead of closing a pane; `write-quit` (`:wq`, `:x`) writes every changed score and quits.
- The audio tool is now called the waveform tool.
- Progress bar matches the Go Playalong look: paper background, solid black dividers, no bluish tint.
- The pane _maximized_ indicator in the titlebar is an icon instead of "Z".

### Fixed

- Progress bar's red position indicator is half as wide in the GUI.
