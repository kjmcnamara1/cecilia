## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-30

### Added

- Scrollbars on score panes (`:scrollbar`, `ui.scrollbar`): pill-shaped thumbs in a light tint of
  the background, in their own gutter so they never overlap the notation. Click or drag to
  scroll, in the GUI and TUI.
- GUI: score panes scroll both ways when the score is bigger than the pane (a narrow vertical
  layout, a tall horizontal layout, a zoomed page), with a scrollbar for each direction. The
  vertical wheel scrolls down and the horizontal wheel (or Shift) across, in every layout.

### Fixed

- GUI: the vertical layout fits panes narrower than 300pt instead of cutting off the bars.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-30

### Added

- Waveform tool: `:waveform` toggles the pane and `:global-tool waveform` toggles its global status.
- Tracks pane refits its height when the buffer of a pane changes.

### Changed

- `close-pane` is now `pane-close`; `quit` (`:q`, `:qa`) exits muse instead of closing a pane; `write-quit` (`:wq`, `:x`) writes every changed score and quits.
- The audio tool is now called the waveform tool.
- Progress bar matches the Go Playalong look: paper background, solid black dividers, no bluish tint.
- The pane _maximized_ indicator in the titlebar is an icon instead of "Z".

### Fixed

- `j`/`k` stop at the last/first row of a track instead of jumping into the neighbouring track.
- Progress bar's red position indicator is half as wide in the GUI.
